 * This class encapsulates the World Object Manager. The World Object Manager is
 * an implementation of the Facade and Singleton design patterns. It contains
 * the list of all World Objects in the scene. It loops through the list to call
 * each object's respective renderers (meshes and icons).
 *
 * This class inherits from QObject in order to listen for expire timer events.
 * It keeps track of objects whose timer has expired and deletes them.
 * Deallocation of world objects should only be done through the
 * removeWorldObject method.
