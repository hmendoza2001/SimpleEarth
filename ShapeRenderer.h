 * This class encapsulates the functionality to render 2D and 3D shapes. A shape
 * is basically a set of points (ground points) that are similar in nature to
 * those defined in an ESRI shapefile, but with possible associated height data
 * (height points). If the shape does have height data associated with it, the
 * 3D volume is achieved by extruding the original shape.
