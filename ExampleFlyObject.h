/**
 * This example shows you how easy it is to emplace an object in the world that
 * has both an icon and a model associated to it and that flies around the
 * equator. This class inherits from QThread to update the object's position on
 * a different thread (like you would do in a real world application). This
 * class takes some shortcuts for illustration purposes. Please refer to
 * ExampleExpirableObject for a class that could better serve as a template for
 * more reralistic applications.
 *
 * Note: In order to load the model you must include the Assimp library
 * dependency.
