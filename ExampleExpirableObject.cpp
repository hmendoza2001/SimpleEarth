 * OVERRIDE FOR QThread. This method runs on a separate thread. In a real-life
 * scenario, you would probably receive object updates by polling a GPS device
 * or from the network. Therefore, you might want objects to disappear from the
 * screen once you stop receiving updates for them, let's say after 5 seconds of
 * not hearing from them for example. It turns out WorldObjectManager makes it easy
 * to accomplish this with expirable objects.
 *
 * Additionally, on the ExampleFlyObject example, we were actually taking some
 * shortcuts that we probably shouldn't have. For example, we were directly
 * updating the object's position without fetching the object from
 * WorldObjectManager which is a bad idea since memory is managed by the manager and
 * the object could be null or expired. This example takes things one step
 * further and is more realistic in the way we update the object's position and
 * orientation simulating an "external" source.
